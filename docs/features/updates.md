# Updates

By default, Tinycast checks GitHub Releases once a day, offers the newest release for its own channel in a native
window with its release notes, installs it and relaunches. This fork reads releases from
`root-daemon/tinycast-autoquit`; its repository-specific cache cannot offer a cached upstream release. There is no Sparkle and no appcast: the
release feed the website already reads is the feed the app reads.

## Invariants

- **This fork updates from its own GitHub Releases.** There is no fork Homebrew tap or external
  publishing integration. The updater’s repository and cache are separate from upstream.
- **The archive is a zip, never the DMG.** A zip expands with `ditto`; a DMG would have to be mounted,
  which means a volume, a Spotlight handle and a detach that can fail. A release published without a
  zip is not installable and is not offered.
- **The zip is chosen by architecture.** A stable release carries a thin arm64 zip and a
  `-Universal-` one. Intel takes the universal zip and is offered *nothing* if it is missing, since a
  thin build would install and then refuse to launch; Apple silicon prefers the thin zip and falls
  back to universal.
- **Nobody ever runs `xattr`.** An archive Tinycast fetched itself is not quarantined — macOS sets
  that flag for sandboxed downloaders and for apps that opt in with `LSFileQuarantineEnabled`, and
  Tinycast is neither. `Quarantine` checks anyway through `getxattr`/`removexattr` rather than the
  `xattr` tool, and an app that still carries the flag is refused rather than installed.
- **The signature is the only integrity guarantee.** A downloaded bundle is trusted only when its
  seal validates, nested helper included, and its leaf certificate exactly matches the running app.
  This fork does not trust the upstream Developer ID team. Certificate rotation requires a manual
  installation; the initial ad-hoc build must also be replaced manually by a consistently signed one.
- **A build only ever updates within its own channel.** The channels are separate bundle ids installed
  side by side; crossing would mean installing a different app. `com.tinycast.app.dev` never updates
  at all, and does not advertise the command.
- **Nothing is installed unless every check passes.** Bundle id, version and signature are all checked
  on the expanded copy before `replaceItemAt` runs, and the running app survives any failure untouched.
- **Relaunching goes through `NSApp.terminate`, never `exit`.** That is what flushes a pending note
  draft and hands back the Hyper Key's HID-level caps remap, which outlives the process.
- **An automatic prompt defers to whatever the user is doing, and is never spent unshown.**
  `UpdateReadiness` withholds it while a snippet is expanding, an extension command is running, an
  uninstall is trashing, a shortcut is being recorded, a prompt or dialog is up, or the palette is
  open. A withheld prompt is still owed: `presentIfAvailable` answers `false`, the version is left
  unannounced, and the pump re-offers it every two minutes for half an hour before falling back to
  the daily rhythm. That is what a hand-launched copy depends on — its one announcement falls 30 s
  in, straight into the palette the user opened the app to use, where a launch-at-login copy would
  have found the desktop idle. The window itself still appears at most once per version per launch:
  `announcedVersion` is set the moment an offer lands, so re-offering can never turn into nagging.
  Readiness is asked again at the click.
- **Automatic checking is optional; manual checking stays available.** Settings → General →
  Automatically check for updates defaults on. Turning it off stops the background task and any
  in-flight automatic request, so neither a response nor a cached release can raise a new prompt.
  The preference travels through settings backups and `general.automaticallyCheckForUpdates` in
  settings.json; release metadata and skipped versions stay in the feature's own cache file.
- **The window shows the changelog and nothing else.** CI writes install instructions below
  `<!-- tinycast:install -->`, and `ReleaseNotes.summary` — the single reader of that marker, called
  where the feed is parsed so the cache holds the cut text too — drops them. An app that installs its
  own updates has no use for a Homebrew command, and a body published before the marker existed has
  none, so it comes back whole.
- **The notes are laid out by `ReleaseNotesView`, which is this feature's own.** `AttributedString`
  parses inline styling only; headings and bullets are placed by hand or they arrive as literal `##`
  and `*`. `ExtensionMarkdownView` does the same job and is deliberately not reused — an extension's
  views never leave `Features/Extensions/`.
- **`@handle` and `#304` are linked by the app, never by the release body.** GitHub autolinks both on
  the web, and a bare mention is what notifies the contributor, so the published body keeps them
  plain and `ReleaseNotes` spells them as Markdown links on the way to the window. Both point at
  `ReleaseFeed.repository`, the one place the repo is named.

## Channel and version

`ReleaseChannel` is derived from the bundle id, and nothing else:

| Bundle id | Channel | Takes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `com.tinycast.app` | `.stable` | releases |
| `com.tinycast.app.beta` | `.beta` | prereleases |
| anything else | `.development` | nothing |

`AppVersion` parses `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` and `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-beta.N` with semver precedence: a
prerelease sorts below the release it leads to, and `beta.10` above `beta.9`. Everything else parses
to nil, so an off-shape tag can never be offered as an update. A release whose tag disagrees with
its `prerelease` flag is treated as mis-published and skipped.

The Intel build is *not* a channel. It shares the stable tag, version, bundle id and signature, so it
resolves to `.stable` like any other; `ReleaseArchitecture` picks its asset, and nothing about
identity changes.

## Checking

`UpdateCheckStore` copies `CurrencyRateStore`: a private `.ephemeral`, `urlCache = nil` session, a
self-rescheduling pump, and one atomic JSON file.

```text
~/Library/Caches/<bundle-id>/update-check-root-daemon-tinycast-autoquit.json
```

It holds `lastCheckedAt`, the newest release seen, and the version the user dismissed. Freshness is
measured from `lastCheckedAt`, so relaunching never re-asks GitHub; the interval is 24 h, dropping to
2 h after a failed attempt, and the first check waits 30 s so it never lands in the login rush. The
request carries a `User-Agent`, which the GitHub API rejects requests without.

Disabling automatic checks takes effect immediately and survives relaunch. Turning them back on
resumes the same schedule, with the startup delay and cached check time respected. Check for Updates
always works independently of this preference, including while automatic checking is disabled.

**Later means skip.** It records the version, so that release stops asking; a newer one still asks.
Check for Updates ignores the record and always offers whatever is newer than what is running.

## Installing

One route, whatever the install came from:

1. Stream the zip into `~/Library/Caches/<bundle-id>/Updates/`, with real byte progress and a Cancel
   that actually aborts the transfer.
2. `ditto -x -k` it into a staging folder, and take whatever `.app` lands there — the bundle is named
   for its channel, so it is `Tinycast Beta.app` on beta.
3. Check quarantine natively; clear it if somehow present, and refuse the update if it survives.
4. Verify the bundle id, the version, and that the code signature is valid and proves the bundle is
   ours — by the running app’s own leaf certificate.
5. `FileManager.replaceItemAt`. The staging folder is on the same volume as `/Applications`, which is
   what lets this be atomic. A non-writable `/Applications` is reported, not worked around; there is
   no privileged helper.
6. Offer Relaunch, which spawns a detached waiter that reopens the app once this process exits —
   `open` on a bundle id that is still running would only re-activate the instance on its way out.

Nothing here touches `~/Library/Preferences`, `~/Library/Caches` or `Application Support`, so no
setting, clipboard entry, note or snippet is affected by an update, by `brew upgrade`, or by both.

## Releasing into it

The fork’s Release workflow validates, signs and packages Apple silicon and universal variants before
publishing one release with both DMGs, both ZIPs and `SHA256SUMS`. Both channels use the same stored
certificate. ZIPs are made with `ditto -c -k --keepParent --sequesterRsrc` so their seals survive.
See [release.md](../release.md) for the workflow and [signing.md](../signing.md) for the identity.

Release notes put changelog content above `<!-- tinycast:install -->` and manual-install information
below it. This fork does not update an upstream Homebrew tap or send release announcements.
